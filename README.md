# Relay Script
 For us to impliment relays at any location

This script can be setup in the following ways.

On: Windows
In the dist folder, there is a folder called Windows. To run the program. Copy that folder onto a windows machine directly in the C:/ folder. The path sould be C:/GenericRelayModule. modify the config in it, and then proceed to run the shortcut labeled "Run Relays". 

On: Linux
There are two ways to run this program on linux. One is through the source code given below. However the other is through the executable provided in the dist Folder. I will explain the executable version here.
